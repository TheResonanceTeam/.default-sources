Added the option to update TrollStore-installed apps directly within the application.\n3. Added the ability to update TrollApps in-app by adding the Resonance Team repository.\n4.

Changed the style of repository and app lists to better use space.\n7. Relocated the \"\"All Apps\"\" list to a more intuitive space.\n8. Changed the search bar for iOS 15+ to use the apple inbuilt version, and created a similar version for iOS 14 users.\n9. Updated the style of the GET/OPEN/OLDER buttons in the app details view to match the AppStore's style.\n10. Implemented the ability to download apps directly from repository lists without needing to view the app details first.\n## Performance and Fixes\n1. Addressed reported bugs from version 2.0\n2. Resolved an issue where in certain cases you could not select apps in the edit mode (they'd be auto un-selected)\n3. Updated the Sources navbar icon, resolving compatibility issues on iOS 14.\n## Miscellaneous\n- Introduced general app speed improvements.\n- Various minor tweaks and adjustments for an overall better user experience.",
