Updated the style of the GET/OPEN/OLDER buttons in the app details view to match the AppStore's style.\n10. Implemented the ability to download apps directly from repository lists without needing to view the app details first.\n## Performance and Fixes\n1. Addressed reported bugs from version 2.0\n2.
